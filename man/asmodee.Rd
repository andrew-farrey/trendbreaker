\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or a \code{tibble} containing the response and
explanatory variables used in the \code{models}.}

\item{models}{A list of \code{\link[=trending_model]{trending_model()}} objects,
generated by \code{lm_model}, \code{glm_model}, \code{glm_nb_model}, \code{brm_model} and
similar functions (see \code{?trending::trending_model()}) for details.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{date_index}{The name of a variable corresponding to time, quoted or
not.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha threshold to be used for the prediction interval
calculation; defaults to 0.05, i.e. 95\% prediction intervals are
calculated.}

\item{k}{An \code{integer} indicating the number of recent data points to be
excluded from the trend fitting procedure. Defaults to 7.}

\item{method}{A function used to evaluate model fit. Current choices are
\code{evaluate_aic} (default) and \code{evaluate_resampling}. \code{evaluate_aic} uses
Akaike's Information Criterion instead, which is faster but possibly less
good a selecting models with the best predictive power.
\code{evaluate_resampling} uses cross-validation and, by default, RMSE to assess
model fit.}

\item{method_args}{Optional named list of additional arguments to pass to
method.  Defaults to an empty list.}

\item{simulate_pi}{A \code{logical} indicating if prediction intervals should be
derived by bootstrap using the ciTools package, or calculated
analytically. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{uncertain}{A \code{logical} indicating if uncertainty in the fitted
parameters should be taken into account when deriving prections
intervals. Only used for glm models and if simulate_pi = \code{FALSE}. Defaults
to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_fitting_warnings}{A \code{logical} indicating if results should
include models that triggered warnings (but not errors), during the fitting
procedure. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, as warnings can typically indicate lack of
convergence during the parameter estimation.}

\item{include_prediction_warnings}{A \code{logical} indicating if results should
include models that triggered warnings (but not errors), during the
prediciton stage. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force_positive}{A \code{logical} indicating if prediction should be forced
to be positive (or zero); can be useful when using Gaussian models for
count data, to avoid negative predictions. Defaults to \code{FALSE} for general
\code{data.frame} inputs, and to \code{TRUE} for \code{incidence2} objects.}

\item{keep_intermediate}{A \code{logical} indicating if all output from the
fitting and prediction stages should be returned. If \code{TRUE}, a tibble will
be returned in the fitted_results position of the resulting list output.
If \code{FALSE} (default) fitted_results will be \code{NULL}.}

\value{
An \code{trendbreaker} object (S3 class inheriting \code{list}), containing items
which can be accessed by various accessors - see \code{?trendbreaker-accessors}
}
\description{
This function implements an algorithm for epidemic time series analysis in
aim to detect recent deviation from the trend followed by the data. Data is
first partitioned into 'recent' data, using the last \code{k} observations as
supplementary individuals, and older data used to fit the
trend. Trend-fitting is done by fitting a series of user-specified models for
the time series, with different methods for selecting best fit (see details,
and the argument \code{method}). The prediction interval is then calculated for
the best model, and every data point (including the training set and
supplementary individuals) falling outside are classified as 'outliers'.
}
\details{
Automatic model selection is used to determine the model best
fitting the training data from a list of user-provided models. First, all
models are fitted to the data. Second, models are selected using the
approach specified by the \code{method} argument. The default is
\code{\link[=evaluate_aic]{evaluate_aic()}} which uses Akaike's Information Criteria to assess model
fit penalised by model complexity. This approach is fast, but measures
model fit rather than predictive ability. The alternative is using
\code{\link[=evaluate_resampling]{evaluate_resampling()}}, uses cross-validation (10-fold by default) and
root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess model fit. This approach is likely
to select models with good predictive abilities, but is computationally
intensive. Also, it does not attempt to maximise the explained deviance, so
selected models may have good average predictions but underestimate
uncertainty.
